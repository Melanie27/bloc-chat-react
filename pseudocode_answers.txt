1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
It’s an informal language that developers use to develop algorithms without getting caught up in a given language’s syntax nuances. Developers use pseudocode to express and understanding concepts that they will later implement in an actual programming language. 


2. Nothing would happen if you ran pseudocode on your computer. It is not a functional language. 


1. 
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number 
     PRINT the first number
ELSE
PRINT the second number

2. 
SET first number to 1
INPUT the number
While the number is less than 100 
PRINT the number
INCREMENT the number by 1
ENDWHILE

3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook
FUNCTION phonebookSearch (list, searchTerm) {
FOR index FROM > 0 -> length(list):
IF list[index] == searchTerm THEN
RETURN index
ENDIF
}

4.

var list = ["Melanie", "Aaron", "Julie", "Zelda", "Paul", "Spencer", "Kate"];


function phonebookSearch(list, searchTerm) {
  for (i=0; i <= list.length; i ++) {
    if (list[i] == searchTerm) {
      console.log(list[i]);
      return list[i];
    } 
    
  }
  return "not in the list";
  
}

phonebookSearch(list, "Aaron");
